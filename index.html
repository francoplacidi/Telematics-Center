                        <br />
                        <p>
                          TNNUL is intended to be used for cultural purposes,
                          academic, educational and research by persons authorized
                          by the National University of England. All TNNUL users
                          are responsible for respecting these guidelines and for
                          enforcing the themselves. TNNUL is open to all teachers,
                          researchers and University students or members of adherent
                          institutions within the regulations established by the
                          Academic University or Adherent institution. The node
                          manager may not allow the access to REDUL facilities for
                          members of other organizations, institutes, entities,
                          etc., other than those belonging to the body where the
                          enabled node is found, without the express authorization
                          of the University. Nor may, without this authorization,
                          establish means physical connection to link the enabled
                          node with other networks or computers. The code of conduct
                          detailed in the following points incorporates the rules of
                          conduct of the main networks to which it is accessed
                          through TNNUL. It has been established to remind users the
                          purposes of TNNUL and the fact that it is not about a
                          "secure network" and therefore should not be used for
                          transmit confidential or sensitive data. 1. Use is
                          prohibited of the network for commercial purposes and any
                          other purpose other than those specially authorized by the
                          University. 2. They should not be sent to over the network
                          files that are too large to monopolize the communication
                          channel for too long a period. These files should be
                          divided into smaller sections, which should be transmitted
                          separately. 3. Any service to third parties generated by
                          any of the members of the institutions linked to the
                          network must within the SAT (Third Party Services)
                          regulations of the University. 4. The software licensed to
                          operate on a certain site cannot be transferred through
                          the network without the express authorization of the
                          licensee. 5. "Chains" of letters through the mail are
                          prohibited. email and random bulk mail. Using the network
                          with these purposes is outside the purposes of TNNUL and
                          may cause the rapid network saturation. 6. Since message
                          traffic interactive programs have priority over all other
                          types of transmissions, the extensive use of them can
                          severely degrade the network. This Thus, applications that
                          can make extensive use of messages Interactives are
                          restricted to specially authorized users. 7. The use of
                          rude or offensive language and images is prohibited. Given
                          the the information that circulates is not strictly
                          confidential and also there are various conference centers
                          open to the general public, the use of expressions of this
                          type is strictly prohibited. 8. The "hacking / cracking"
                          of computers using TNNUL as a means of access is strictly
                          prohibited. In the same way the attempt to penetration to
                          other computers or account using "horsepower Trojan ",
                          virus or any other method of" hacking. It is also
                          prohibited the transmission of viruses through the
                          network. 9. The distribution lists email as well as all
                          other traffic in REDUL, may be created when they are in
                          accordance with the objectives of TNNUL. 10. All Users
                          must respect legal restrictions on the data transfer
                          established in the legislation of the Republic Argentina
                          and that of the countries to or from where the data. 11.
                          Excessive use of the network for communications from
                          personal type. When any user violates any of these rules,
                          it will be reported to the institution to which it
                          belongs. In this case the Center of Telematics reserves
                          the right to deny access to TNNUL until both are resolved
                          on the matter, in accordance with resolution no. 51/97.
